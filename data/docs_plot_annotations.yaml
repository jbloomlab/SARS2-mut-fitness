  mut_rates:
    title: neutral mutation rates for each clade
    section: expected
    legend: |
      Interactive plot of neutral mutation rates for each SARS-CoV-2 clade estimated using 
      four-fold degenerate synonymous sites. 

      The plot at left shows the fraction of all mutations at four-fold degenerate sites
      that are of each type, and the plot at right shows the relative rates of these
      mutations obtained after normalized for nucleotide composition.

      You can mouseover points for details, click/shift-click on the bar at bottom to select
      specific mutation types, and click/shift-click on the legend at right to select
      specific clades.

      See [Bloom, Beichman, Neher, & Harris (2022)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.19.517207v1)
      for more details on the mutation rates are estimated.

  avg_counts:
    title: average per-site counts of each nucleotide mutation type
    section: expected
    legend: |
      Interactive plot of average counts per nucleotide site averaged over all clades and
      sites. Counts are reported separately for the expected counts (estimated from
      4-fold degenerate sites) and the counts for all synonymous mutations (including 4-fold
      degenerate sites), nonsynonymous mutations, and stop mutations. Counts are stratified
      by the type of nucleotide change in the mutation.

      You can mouseover points for details and click/shift-click the legend to highlight
      specific types of counts.

  effects_histogram:
    title: distribution of fitness effects of mutations
    section: distribution
    legend: |
      Interactive histograms of the estimated fitness effects of different types of mutations.
      Mutations are stratified by whether they are nonsynonymous, synonymous, or introduce
      a stop codon. Mutations with negative fitness effects are deleterious.

      The *minimum expected count* slider below the plot indicates how many expected counts
      of a mutation we require before making a fitness estimate. Larger values yield more
      accurate estimates but for fewer mutations. Move the slider to the left to show
      estimates for more mutations at lower confidence, and move it to the right to show
      estimates for fewer mutations at higher confidence.

      You can click/shift-click on specific genes in the legend below the plot to show
      only estimates for those genes.

  effects_dist:
    title: mutation fitness effects for each gene
    section: distribution
    legend: |
      Interactive plot of the distribution of fitness effects of different types
      of mutations for each viral gene. The dark squares show the median effect of
      mutations of each type (stop, nonsynonymous, or synonymous), and the light
      rectangles span the interquartile range. Mutations with negative fitness
      effects are deleterious.

      Note that ORF9b is encoded by an alternative overlapping reading frame  with N,
      which complicates interpretation of selection on mutations in this gene.

      You can mouseover the bars for details.

      You can click on the *mutation type* legend to just highlight mutations of
      a specific type.

      The *minimum expected count* slider below the plot indicates how many expected counts
      of a mutation we require before making a fitness estimate. Larger values yield more
      accurate estimates but for fewer mutations. Move the slider to the left to show
      estimates for more mutations at lower confidence, and move it to the right to show
      estimates for fewer mutations at higher confidence.

    section: distribution
    legend: |
      Interactive plot of the distribution of fitness effects of different types
      of mutations for each viral gene. The dark squares show the median effect of
      mutations of each type (stop, nonsynonymous, or synonymous), and the light
      rectangles span the interquartile range. Mutations with negative fitness
      effects are deleterious.

      accurate estimates but for fewer mutations. Move the slider to the left to show
      estimates for more mutations at lower confidence, and move it to the right to show
      estimates for fewer mutations at higher confidence.

  clade_corr_chart: &corr_template
    title: correlation of fitness estimates for different viral clades
    section: correlation
    legend: |
      Interactive plot of the correlation between fitness estimates made using different
      subsets of the sequence data. Each point represents a fitness estimate for a
      different amino-acid mutation. The Pearson correlation coefficient and the number
      of mutations being correlated are shown in the upper left of the scatter plot.

      You can mouse over points for details.
    
      The *minimum expected count* slider below the plot indicates how many expected counts of an
      an amino acid we require before making a fitness estimate. Larger values yield more
      accurate estimates but for fewer amino acids. So move the slider to the left to show
      estimates for more amino acids at lower confidence, and move it to the right to show
      estimates for fewer amino acids at higher confidence.

      This plot only shows the clades with the largest numbers of sequences.

    section: correlation
    legend: |
      Pearson correlation coefficients for fitness estimates for amino-acid mutations
      made from subsets of sequences from different clades or different geographic regions.
      Correlations are calculated separately for spike and non-spike mutations, and the
      x-axis indicates the threshold for minimum expected counts for a mutation to be
      included in the correlations. The correlations
      include only mutations at the sites with the same wildtype identity in the clades.

      You can mouseover points for details.

  dms_S_corr: &dms_S_corr_template
    title: correlation of fitness estimates with spike deep mutational scanning
    section: dms
    legend: |
      Interactive plot correlating the fitness estimates for spike amino-acid mutations
      with experimental measurements of the effects of these mutations in deep mutational
      scanning of the full spike ([Dadonaite et al (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.02.001))
      or just the RBD ([Starr et al (2022)](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1010951)).
      Each point represents an amino-acid mutation. The Pearson correlation coefficient and
      the number of mutations being correlated are shown in the upper left of the scatter plot.

      You can mouse over points for details.

      The *minimum expected count* slider below the plot indicates how many expected counts of an
      an amino acid we require before making a fitness estimate. Larger values yield more
      accurate estimates but for fewer amino acids. So move the slider to the left to show
      estimates for more amino acids at lower confidence, and move it to the right to show
      estimates for fewer amino acids at higher confidence.

      Click *yes* for the *only show mutations measured in all subsets* box to only show
      the same subset of mutations in each panel; otherwise different panels may show
      different subsets of mutations depending on which mutations have measurements or
      fitness estimates for each pair of variables being correlated.

      For the RBD deep mutational scanning, the effects of mutations are averaged across
      the different homolog backgrounds. The *DMS effect RBD* is quantified as the mean
      of the effect of the mutation on ACE2 affinity and RBD expression.

  # heatmaps of mutational effects
  nsp1: &heatmap_template
    section: heatmap
    legend: |
      Interactive plot of fitnesses amino acids at each site estimated from the observed versus
      expected counts of the amino acids among natural sequences.

      The black area plot at top shows the mean fitness for all non-stop amino acids at each
      site, with more negative values
      indicating mutations at a site tend to be deleterious. The plot is zoomable, and you can
      click and drag with the mouse to highlight specific regions to show in the heat map. You
      can use the *site fitness statistic* click box at bottom to change whether the black area
      plot at top shows the mean, maximum, or minimum fitness of amino acids at that site.
      You can use the *show stop* option at bottom to overlay the effect of stop codon mutations
      on this plot.

      The heat map shows the estimated fitness values for specific amino acids. Red indicates
      low fitness (deleterious) amino acids, and blue indicates high fitness amino acids.
      Gray indicates amino acids with insufficient natural evolutionary data to make estimates
      (typically only single-nucleotide accessible amino acids will be shown). You can
      mouse over points in the heat map for details, and zoom using the area plot at top.
      The **x** at each site indicates the wildtype amino acid in the SARS-CoV-2 clade
      indicated by the dropdown box below the plot.

      The *minimum expected count* slider below the plot indicates how many expected counts of an
      an amino acid we require before making a fitness estimate. Larger values yield more
      accurate estimates but for fewer amino acids. So move the slider to the left to show
      estimates for more amino acids at lower confidence, and move it to the right to show
      estimates for fewer amino acids at higher confidence.

  fitness_vs_terminal:
    title: fitness effects versus number of descendant sequences
    section: terminal
    legend: |
      Interactive plot of the correlation between fitness estimates of mutations and number
      of descendants. This plot is designed to help assess whether mutations with higher
      fitness tend to be associated with more descendant sequences.
      
      Two measures are provided for number of descendants. The first is the log ratio
      of branches with the mutation that are internal on the tree (non-terminal)
      versus to (to tip nodes). The second is the log number of tip-node descendants
      sharing all mutations on a branch. In both cases, larger values indicate a mutation
      tends to have more descendants.

      Each point on the plot represents a fitness estimate for a
      different amino-acid mutation. The Pearson correlation coefficient and the number
      of mutations being correlated are shown in the upper left of the scatter plot.
      The mutations are stratified by whether they are nonsynonymous, synonymous, or
      introduce a stop codon.

      You can mouse over points for details.

      The *minimum actual count* slider below the plot indicates the total number of
      observed counts we require for a mutation before it is shown on the plot. The
      non-terminal to terminal ratio may be noisier for smaller values of this threshold,
      although more deleterious mutations are also expected to have lower actual counts.
    
      The *minimum expected count* slider below the plot indicates how many expected counts of an
      an amino acid we require before making a fitness estimate. Larger values yield more
      accurate estimates but for fewer amino acids. So move the slider to the left to show
      estimates for more amino acids at lower confidence, and move it to the right to show
      estimates for fewer amino acids at higher confidence.

      You can click/shift-click on specific genes in the legend below the plot to only
      show mutations for that gene.

      The log ratio of the non-terminal to terminal counts is computed after adding a
      pseudocount of 0.5 to each count.

  clade_fixed_muts:
    title: fitness effects of mutations fixed in at least one clade
    section: fixed
    legend: |
      Interactive plot of the fitness effects of amino-acid mutations fixed in at least one clade,
      stratified by non-spike and spike mutations. The point shapes show the overall fitness
      estimate using data from all clades, the estimates from just forward mutation counts
      in clades without the mutation, and the estimates (when available) for direct amino-acid
      reversions in clades with the mutation fixed. Note that we exclude direct nucleotide
      reversions in counts because they are error-prone due to calling to consensus, and so
      reversion estimates are often unavailable. Missing points indicate no estimate can be
      made for a mutation from the available data.

      Mouseover points for details.

      The *minimum expected count* slider below the plot indicates how many expected counts of an
      an amino acid we require before making a fitness estimate. Larger values yield more
      accurate estimates but for fewer amino acids. So move the slider to the left to show
      estimates for more amino acids at lower confidence, and move it to the right to show
      estimates for fewer amino acids at higher confidence.

      You can click/shift-click on specific genes in the legend below the plot to only
      show mutations for that gene.
  clade_fixed_muts_hist:
    title: fitness effects of mutations fixed in a clade versus all mutations
    section: fixed
    legend: |
      The histograms show the effects of all mutations (to the reference genome)
      with fitness estimates, and just those mutations that have fixed in a clade.

      The *minimum expected count* slider below the plot indicates how many expected counts of an
      an amino acid we require before making a fitness estimate. Larger values yield more
      accurate estimates but for fewer amino acids. So move the slider to the left to show
      estimates for more amino acids at lower confidence, and move it to the right to show
      estimates for fewer amino acids at higher confidence.

  mat_aa_fitness_correlations:  
    title: correlation of fitness effects estimated from different sequence sets
    section: mats
    legend: |
      The scatter plots show the correlation of amino-acid fitness effects estimated using different
      sets of sequences.

      The line and orange text show the Pearson correlation.

      Mouse over points for details on specific mutations.

      The *minimum expected count* slider below the plot indicates how many expected counts of an

      estimates for fewer amino acids at higher confidence.

  dnds_corr:
    title: correlation of dN/dS with site-average fitness estimates and DMS data
    section: comparisons
    legend: |
      The top plot shows the correlation between log dN/dS estimates and the site-average mean
      estimated fitness effects of amino-acid mutations for each gene.

      The bottom plot shows how well the site-average mutational effect measured in deep
      mutational scanning (DMS) experiments correlates with the site-average mean
      estimated fitness effects of mutations, or the log dN/dS values.

      The plots are interactive and you can mouse over points for detail.

      The dN/dS values are taken from [here](https://github.com/spond/SARS-CoV-2-variation).

  comparator_corr:
    title: correlation of mutation effect estimates from other studies with fitness estimates and spike DMS data
    section: comparisons
    legend: |
      This plot correlates the mutation effects estimated in three other studies with the fitness
      effects estimated in the current study and full-spike deep mutational scanning from
      [Dadonaite et al (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.02.001).

      The mutation effects being used in the comparisons are from the following studies:

        - [Maher et al (2022)](https://www.science.org/doi/suppl/10.1126/scitranslmed.abk3445)
        - [Rodriguez-Rivas et al (2022)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2113118119)
        - [Thadani et al (2023)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.21.501023v2)

      For Rodriguez-Rivas et al, only site estimates are provided so the correlation is with
      the site-mean estimated fitness and measured DMS values. For the other studies,
      the correlation is with the mutation effects. Each row only shows points for mutations/sites
      measured by all three methods.
