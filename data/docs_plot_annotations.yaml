    Interactive plot of fitnesses amino acids at each site estimated from the observed versus
    actual counts of the amino acids among natural sequences.

    The black area plot at top shows the mean fitness for each site, with more negative values
    indicating mutations at a site tend to be deleterious. The plot is zoomable, and you can
    click and drag with the mouse to highlight specific regions to show in the heat map. You
    can use the *site fitness statistic* click box at bottom to change whether the black area
    plot at top shows the mean, maximum, or minimum fitness of amino acids at that site.

    The heat map shows the estimated fitness values for specific amino acids. Red indicates
    low fitness (deleterious) amino acids, and blue indicates high fitness amino acids.
    Gray indicates amino acids with insufficient natural evolutionary data to make estimates
    (typically only single-nucleotide accessible amino acids will be shown). You can
    mouse over points in the heat map for details, and zoom using the area plot at top.
    The **x** at each site indicates the wildtype amino acid in the SARS-CoV-2 clade
    indicated by the dropdown box below the plot.

    The *minimum expected count* slider below the plot indicates how many expected counts of an
    an amino acid we require before making a fitness estimate. Larger values yield more
    accurate estimates but for fewer amino acids. So move the slider to the left to show
    estimates for more amino acids at lower confidence, and move it to the right to show
    estimates for fewer amino acids at higher confidence. Values in a range of 10 to 20
    are usually sufficient to yield reasonably accurate estimates.
